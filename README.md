It was a simple fix!

I've cloned my part from our submission for the Treblle API Hackathon from the Initial repo. 
This is to continue on it and I would love to keep other's part as it for future reference.

Of course, I'm not happy with our early departure from the competition (We couldn't even get shortlisted for the next stage). I think it was a simple fix, what a foolish mistake. This realization was more painful after seeing the submissions of some who qualified and I have to live with it.

"We were better", you say. But why didn't you make the cut? 

The answer is simple yet overlooked!
